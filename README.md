# 👋 Hi there! I'm [Your Name]  

## 🎓 About Me  

💻 **NLP Student** | 📚 **Language Analysis Enthusiast** | 🌟 **Aspiring AI Researcher**  

Hi! I’m **Jeffrey**, a student deeply passionate about **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **language analysis**. My work focuses on understanding how machines can process, analyze, and interpret human language at deeper semantic, syntactic, and lexical levels.  

I love exploring **text analysis techniques** and leveraging **machine learning** to solve problems like text classification, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis.
